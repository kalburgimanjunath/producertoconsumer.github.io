I actually wrote this little experiment whilst on a plane to San Francisco a couple of months ago (more on that soon) but then totally forgot about it. I had some time last week and remembered it – I tidied it up and [here](http://codepen.io/minimalmonkey/full/btqpG) it is.

<div style="width: 100%; height: 400px;">
	<iframe style="border: none;" name="bezel-lines" src="http://minimalmonkey.com/lab/dynamic-bezel-lines/" width="100%" height="400px" frameborder="0" scrolling="auto"></iframe>
</div>

It’s inspired by [this](http://www.behance.net/gallery/90-minutes-silkscreen-poster/5863759) piece of art work from my good friend [Tobias](http://www.vanschneider.com/). At first I made it so the art work was just generated by code but it was kind of boring. I then added the interaction so the depth amount was defined by the mouse position. This instantly made it much more interesting and fun to play with.

A quick summary of how it works. I use canvas to either write text or draw an image to. I then get the canvas data and loop through each pixel on the determined lines. When I hit a pixel that isn’t transparent I store it’s position and do likewise when I next hit a transparent pixel. I then use bezier curves to make the lines nice and smooth. I’ll let you explore the code further [here](http://codepen.io/minimalmonkey/pen/btqpG) to see how it works. Post a comment if you have any questions about the code – I’m always happy to help.
