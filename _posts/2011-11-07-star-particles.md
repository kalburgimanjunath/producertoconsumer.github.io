Two posts in two days! Just made a star version of the fun particle thing I made yesterday! View a full window version [here](http://www.flashmonkey.co.uk/lab/js-particles/stars/). The stars are drawn with code and you can play around with the code on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/flash-monkey/pen/jbyKB).
